# python-projects
Description: These projects were based off of assignments provided by MIT's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python course online which can be found here: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/index.htm

How to run: To run these programs, open in PyCharm and press run

Program Descriptions:

Hangman: This file lets you play the game "Hangman" against a computer. The computer will randomly select a word and you have 6 incorrect tries to guess letters in the computer's chosen word. If you would like a hint to see all the possible words that computer could have chosen, you can input the character "*"
*note: make sure the text.txt file is in the same folder as the hangman program

ps3: This program is a word game that is similar to scrabble. The program ask the player how many hands/rounds the player wants to play for the game. The player will then play that many hands for the gam The program will then deal out 7 letters to the player including a "*" character that can be used to replace any vowel (ex. instead of typing owl, the player should type *wl). The player receives points for each word they are able to make, but * characters will not provide any points. The player can also ask to substitute 1 type of letter from their hand for different letters once per game. The player can also ask to replay his hand, which will reset his hand to its original tiles, but the points for the round will also be reset. When the game is over, the program will tell the player what his final score is.

ps4: Encryption library practice
  ps4a: This function gives all the permutations of a string

  ps4b: This program can perform a Caesar Cipher on a text string given a shift integer. It can also decrypt a Caesar Cipher without knowing the shift integer and outputs the hidden text and the original shift integer.
 *note: make sure the text.txt file is in the same folder as the program

  ps4c: This program can encrypt by switching vowels in a text with other vowels, given a vowel permutation. It can also decrypt text without being given the original encryption permutation
*note: make sure the text.txt file is in the same folder as the program
